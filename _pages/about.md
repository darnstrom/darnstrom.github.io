### About me
I received my M.Sc degree in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering in 2018 from Linköping University, Sweden, where I have since pursued a PhD in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Daniel Axehill](https://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/daniel/). In March 2021 I successfully defended my licentiate thesis with the title ["On Complexity Certification of Active-Set QP Methods with Applications to Linear MPC"](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1533096).  

My research interest is in embedded optimization and real-time Model Predictive control (MPC), with the general goal of ensuring that optimization solvers that are employed in real-time can find a solution within a limited time frame. This goal can be approached from two distinct, complementary, directions: 
1. Developing efficient optimization solvers, tailored for the given problem and hardware at hand (see, for example, [DAQP](https://github.com/darnstrom/daqp).) 
2. Developing methods that determines worst-case bounds on the computational complexity for the solvers that are employed (see, for example, [ASCertain.jl](https://github.com/darnstrom/ASCertain.jl)).
