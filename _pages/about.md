### About me
In 2023 I successfully defended my thesis ["Real-Time Certified MPC: Reliable Active-Set QP Solvers"](https://doi.org/10.3384/9789180752190), granting me a PhD in Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Automatic Control from Linköping University, Sweden. Previously, I had received a M.Sc and a Licentiate degree, also from Linköping University, in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

My research interests are in embedded optimization and real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC), with the general goal of ensuring that optimization solvers that are employed in real time can find a solution within a limited time frame. To this end, two complementary research directions of interest are:
1. Developing efficient optimization solvers, tailored for the given problem and hardware at hand (see, for example, [DAQP](https://github.com/darnstrom/daqp).) 
2. Developing methods that determine worst-case bounds on the computational complexity for the solvers that are employed (see, for example, [ASCertain.jl](https://github.com/darnstrom/ASCertain.jl)).
