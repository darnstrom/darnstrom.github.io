### About me
I am a Postdoc at the [Division of Systems and Control](http://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/systems_and_control), Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden. 
My research interests include reliable embedded optimization and reliable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC); for reliability, my research interests include computational, safety, and security aspects.

In 2023 I successfully defended my thesis ["Real-Time Certified MPC: Reliable Active-Set QP Solvers"](https://doi.org/10.3384/9789180752190), granting me a PhD in Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Automatic Control from Linköping University, Sweden. Previously, I had received a M.Sc and a Licentiate degree, also from Linköping University, in 2018 and 2021, respectively.
The general goal of my thesis was to ensure that optimization solvers that are employed in real time can find a solution within a limited time frame. To this end, two complementary research directions considered in it are:
1. Developing efficient optimization solvers, tailored for the given problem and hardware at hand (see, for example, [DAQP](https://github.com/darnstrom/daqp).) 
2. Developing methods that determine worst-case bounds on the computational complexity for the solvers that are employed (see, for example, [ASCertain.jl](https://github.com/darnstrom/ASCertain.jl)).
